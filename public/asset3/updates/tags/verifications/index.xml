This second phase of the merge consists of combining two components: credit balances and credit orders/order history.
Credits balances associated with your account will be merged on both Textverified and Phoneblur. This means that your credit balance will be shared between both sites, so you will no longer have to manage your balance on both Textverified and Phoneblur when you consume our services.</description></item><item><title>Textverified and Phoneblur Merge</title><link>https://www.textverified.com/updates/textverified-and-phoneblur-merge/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.textverified.com/updates/textverified-and-phoneblur-merge/</guid><description>We are excited to announce that we are in the process of merging Textverified and Phoneblur into one site. This consolidation will provide you with a more streamlined and improved experience. However, during this transition period, you will experience temporary redirects between the two sites.
This first phase of the merge consists of combining two key components: account information/access and the support ticket system.
Account information/access refers to pages related to logging in and managing your user account, such as changing passwords and setting up two-factor authentication (2FA).</description></item><item><title>Update: More Numbers, Better Service</title><link>https://www.textverified.com/updates/update-more-numbers-better-service/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.textverified.com/updates/update-more-numbers-better-service/</guid><description>Hey Textverified and Phoneblur users, a great new update is coming your way: we&amp;rsquo;ve been working hard to increase our supply of available phone number rental lines.
Starting with temporary single service, you&amp;rsquo;ll soon see greater availability for rental numbers. Permanent multi-purpose lines will be up next, followed by permanent single service.
Now you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to buy larger quantities of number rentals from our rapidly-growing supply. We&amp;rsquo;ll be restocking popular numbers more frequently, and a bigger supply also means that maximum purchase allowances will increase.</description></item><item><title>Flexible Purchases - A New Way to Verify</title><link>https://www.textverified.com/updates/flexible-purchases-a-new-way-to-verify/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.textverified.com/updates/flexible-purchases-a-new-way-to-verify/</guid><description>Have you noticed that we&amp;rsquo;ve been making some changes lately here at Textverified?
