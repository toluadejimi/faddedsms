With this update:
Billing cycles will now only automatically renew at the end of the cycle instead of a week in advance.
Rentals that fail to renew and become overdue can now be directly renewed and restored to their billing cycle from the Overdue Rentals page - you no longer need to renew from the billing cycle or reactivate them.</description></item><item><title>Textverified Discord Bot</title><link>https://www.textverified.com/updates/textverified-discord-bot/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.textverified.com/updates/textverified-discord-bot/</guid><description>Textverified has created a Discord bot that lets you use Textverified features through Discord.

When you initiate a new verification, you receive a certain amount of time to access your verification code.
Sometimes you may want to start a second verification, but you&amp;rsquo;re stuck waiting for the timer to run down on your first verification.
Now you can have two &amp;ldquo;pending&amp;rdquo; verifications active at the same time!
If you purchase $50 in credit via Textverified, this option will be available to you immediately &amp;ndash; you can do this in a single transaction, or multiple smaller transactions that add up to $50.</description></item><item><title>Textverified: Features Page</title><link>https://www.textverified.com/updates/textverified-features-page/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.textverified.com/updates/textverified-features-page/</guid><description>More big news for our Textverified users: we now have a concise, easy-to-read Features page up on our site!

Textverified Search Bar &amp;ndash; We&amp;rsquo;ve made some improvements to our search bar on the &amp;ldquo;Text &amp;amp; SMS&amp;rdquo; Verifications page.

Over the last few months, we&amp;rsquo;ve heard from many users who wanted an option to reuse old verification phone numbers. Now you can with Resurrect.
Before Resurrect, users could reuse phone numbers for about two minutes immediately after the initial activation. But if you needed to reverify a few hours later, you&amp;rsquo;d be stuck.
With Resurrect, you now have the option to resurrect a phone number as long as it is still available within our database.</description></item></channel></rss>
