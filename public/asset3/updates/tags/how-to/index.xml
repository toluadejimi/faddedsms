With this update:
Billing cycles will now only automatically renew at the end of the cycle instead of a week in advance.
Rentals that fail to renew and become overdue can now be directly renewed and restored to their billing cycle from the Overdue Rentals page - you no longer need to renew from the billing cycle or reactivate them.</description></item><item><title>Phoneblur: Changes to Message Handling</title><link>https://www.textverified.com/updates/phoneblur-changes-to-message-handling/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.textverified.com/updates/phoneblur-changes-to-message-handling/</guid><description>We are rolling out new changes to how you can view and receive your messages for lines you have rented on Phoneblur. In addition to the view of all your messages, you can also view just your messages for a specific subscription or the messages for a specific line in one of your subscriptions. This enables you to just see the messages you currently care about.
Viewing Your Messages
The easiest way to view all the messages all your lines have received is to click &amp;ldquo;Messages&amp;rdquo; in the top bar:</description></item><item><title>Phoneblur Feature: Requesting A Service</title><link>https://www.textverified.com/updates/phoneblur-feature-requesting-a-service/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.textverified.com/updates/phoneblur-feature-requesting-a-service/</guid><description>Did you know you can make requests for popular services? We now offer this feature for both temporary and permanent rentals.
Sometimes you might require a specific service that is currently unavailable on our sites. This service will show up under our service listings, but when you click &amp;ldquo;Add,&amp;rdquo; you will be taken to a provisioning request page.
On the provisioning request page, you will be able to request the service and pay for it: we&amp;rsquo;ll either get the service up and running in three days or we&amp;rsquo;ll refund your money.</description></item><item><title>Phoneblur: Multiple Permanent Subscriptions</title><link>https://www.textverified.com/updates/phoneblur-multiple-permanent-subscriptions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.textverified.com/updates/phoneblur-multiple-permanent-subscriptions/</guid><description>Did you know that you can hold multiple permanent subscriptions under a single Phoneblur account?
When you purchase a new permanent rental service or whole line, you can choose whether you want to add it to your Primary subscription or if you&amp;rsquo;d like to create a new subscription.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a screenshot of an account with a single permanent subscription for Coinbase:
Now we&amp;rsquo;re going to add a second permanent subscription to Instagram:</description></item><item><title>Textverified: Features Page</title><link>https://www.textverified.com/updates/textverified-features-page/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.textverified.com/updates/textverified-features-page/</guid><description>More big news for our Textverified users: we now have a concise, easy-to-read Features page up on our site!

Over the last few months, we&amp;rsquo;ve heard from many users who wanted an option to reuse old verification phone numbers. Now you can with Resurrect.
Before Resurrect, users could reuse phone numbers for about two minutes immediately after the initial activation. But if you needed to reverify a few hours later, you&amp;rsquo;d be stuck.
With Resurrect, you now have the option to resurrect a phone number as long as it is still available within our database.</description></item><item><title>New Payment Option: Amazon Pay</title><link>https://www.textverified.com/updates/new-payment-option-amazon-pay/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.textverified.com/updates/new-payment-option-amazon-pay/</guid><description>Lately we&amp;rsquo;ve received some feedback from our users asking for a credit card payment option. We hear you and we agree &amp;ndash; so today we&amp;rsquo;re introducing Amazon Pay for Textverified. We&amp;rsquo;ll also be adding Amazon Pay to PhoneBlur soon.
Amazon Pay is a great option for small bundle purchases if you don&amp;rsquo;t use crypto currency &amp;ndash; but since we&amp;rsquo;ll be processing payments through third party credit card companies, we do need to add a small percentage surcharge to any Amazon Pay purchases.</description></item></channel></rss>
