You can now verify your AdGate accounts on the same line with SMS and/or voice with our number rentals. This means that you will no longer purchase AdGate verifications – instead, you will purchase the AdGate service on our rentals.
This feature is still in beta and we have limited supply. Please give us any feedback or comments you may have.</description></item></channel></rss>
