We&amp;rsquo;ve cut prices by up to 40% on over 200 of our most popular services.
We know you have lots of options for your verifying needs, but we&amp;rsquo;d like you to stick around with us. With our new lower prices, you won&amp;rsquo;t have to choose between exceptional service and low-cost rentals. We still offer the same great service you&amp;rsquo;re used to, but with extremely competitive prices.</description></item><item><title>Flexible Purchases - A New Way to Verify</title><link>https://www.textverified.com/updates/flexible-purchases-a-new-way-to-verify/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.textverified.com/updates/flexible-purchases-a-new-way-to-verify/</guid><description>Have you noticed that we&amp;rsquo;ve been making some changes lately here at Textverified?
