With this update:
Billing cycles will now only automatically renew at the end of the cycle instead of a week in advance.
Rentals that fail to renew and become overdue can now be directly renewed and restored to their billing cycle from the Overdue Rentals page - you no longer need to renew from the billing cycle or reactivate them.</description></item><item><title>Subscription Renewal Improvements: Automatic Retries</title><link>https://www.textverified.com/updates/subscription-renewal-improvements-automatic-retries/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.textverified.com/updates/subscription-renewal-improvements-automatic-retries/</guid><description>We have made some updates to subscription renewal, including a highly requested feature: automatic subscription renewal retries! If renewal fails and you top up your account, but forget to manually renew your subscription, we&amp;rsquo;ll take care of it for you. We&amp;rsquo;ll attempt a second renewal before your subscription expires. Note that this will only occur for new subscriptions or subscriptions that have successfully renewed after October 18th, 2022.
There are also other smaller changes related to renewal that have been made, which are detailed below:</description></item><item><title>Shorter Rentals and Instant Availability</title><link>https://www.textverified.com/updates/shorter-rentals-and-instant-availability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.textverified.com/updates/shorter-rentals-and-instant-availability/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re excited to announce that we are now selling shorter temporary numbers (1 day and 3 day) as well as offering the option of buying any of our products with instant availability (no need to ever hit Wake Up before using your line).
Shorter Rentals
In addition to being able to purchase a number for a single service for one week or two weeks, you now have the option to reserve a line for only one or three days for a reduced price.</description></item><item><title>Update: More Numbers, Better Service</title><link>https://www.textverified.com/updates/update-more-numbers-better-service/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.textverified.com/updates/update-more-numbers-better-service/</guid><description>Hey Textverified and Phoneblur users, a great new update is coming your way: we&amp;rsquo;ve been working hard to increase our supply of available phone number rental lines.
Starting with temporary single service, you&amp;rsquo;ll soon see greater availability for rental numbers. Permanent multi-purpose lines will be up next, followed by permanent single service.
Now you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to buy larger quantities of number rentals from our rapidly-growing supply. We&amp;rsquo;ll be restocking popular numbers more frequently, and a bigger supply also means that maximum purchase allowances will increase.</description></item><item><title>New Payment Options for Textverified: Alipay</title><link>https://www.textverified.com/updates/new-payment-options-for-textverified-alipay/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.textverified.com/updates/new-payment-options-for-textverified-alipay/</guid><description>Looking to purchase more credits for your Textverified account?

When you purchase a new permanent rental service or whole line, you can choose whether you want to add it to your Primary subscription or if you&amp;rsquo;d like to create a new subscription.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a screenshot of an account with a single permanent subscription for Coinbase:

We&amp;rsquo;ve recently launched some exciting new updates and wanted to tell you about them:
Textverified Search Bar &amp;ndash; We&amp;rsquo;ve made some improvements to our search bar on the &amp;ldquo;Text &amp;amp; SMS&amp;rdquo; Verifications page. Now if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a specific service, you can find it directly by using our &amp;ldquo;Short-term / temporary numbers&amp;rdquo; search bar.

Over the last few months, we&amp;rsquo;ve heard from many users who wanted an option to reuse old verification phone numbers. Now you can with Resurrect.
Before Resurrect, users could reuse phone numbers for about two minutes immediately after the initial activation. But if you needed to reverify a few hours later, you&amp;rsquo;d be stuck.
With Resurrect, you now have the option to resurrect a phone number as long as it is still available within our database.</description></item><item><title>New Payment Option: Amazon Pay</title><link>https://www.textverified.com/updates/new-payment-option-amazon-pay/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.textverified.com/updates/new-payment-option-amazon-pay/</guid><description>Lately we&amp;rsquo;ve received some feedback from our users asking for a credit card payment option. We hear you and we agree &amp;ndash; so today we&amp;rsquo;re introducing Amazon Pay for Textverified. We&amp;rsquo;ll also be adding Amazon Pay to PhoneBlur soon.
Amazon Pay is a great option for small bundle purchases if you don&amp;rsquo;t use crypto currency &amp;ndash; but since we&amp;rsquo;ll be processing payments through third party credit card companies, we do need to add a small percentage surcharge to any Amazon Pay purchases.</description></item><item><title>Flexible Purchases - A New Way to Verify</title><link>https://www.textverified.com/updates/flexible-purchases-a-new-way-to-verify/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.textverified.com/updates/flexible-purchases-a-new-way-to-verify/</guid><description>Have you noticed that we&amp;rsquo;ve been making some changes lately here at Textverified?
